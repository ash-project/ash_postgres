# Rules for working with AshPostgres

## Understanding AshPostgres

AshPostgres is the PostgreSQL data layer for Ash Framework. It's the most fully-featured Ash data layer and should be your default choice unless you have specific requirements for another data layer. Any PostgreSQL version higher than 13 is fully supported.

## Migrations and Codegen

### Development Migration Workflow (Recommended)

For development iterations, use the dev workflow to avoid naming migrations prematurely:

1. Make resource changes
2. Run `mix ash.codegen --dev` to generate and run dev migrations
3. Review the migrations and run `mix ash.migrate` to run them
4. Continue making changes and running `mix ash.codegen --dev` as needed
5. When your feature is complete, run `mix ash.codegen add_feature_name` to generate final named migrations (this will rollback dev migrations and squash them)
3. Review the migrations and run `mix ash.migrate` to run them

### Traditional Migration Generation

For single-step changes or when you know the final feature name:

1. Run `mix ash.codegen add_feature_name` to generate migrations
2. Review the generated migrations in `priv/repo/migrations`
3. Run `mix ash.migrate` to apply the migrations

> **Tip**: The dev workflow (`--dev` flag) is preferred during development as it allows you to iterate without thinking of migration names and provides better development ergonomics.

> **Warning**: Always review migrations before applying them to ensure they are correct and safe.

## Multitenancy

AshPostgres supports schema-based multitenancy:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Tenant do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  # Resource definition...

  postgres do
    table "tenants"
    repo MyApp.Repo

    # Automatically create/manage tenant schemas
    manage_tenant do
      template ["tenant_", :id]
    end
  end
end
```

### Setting Up Multitenancy

1. Configure your repo to support multitenancy:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo do
  use AshPostgres.Repo, otp_app: :my_app

  # Return all tenant schemas for migrations
  def all_tenants do
    import Ecto.Query, only: [from: 2]
    all(from(t in "tenants", select: fragment("? || ?", "tenant_", t.id)))
  end
end
```

2. Mark resources that should be multi-tenant:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post do
  use Ash.Resource,
    data_layer: AshPostgres.DataLayer

  multitenancy do
    strategy :context
    attribute :tenant
  end

  # Resource definition...
end
```

3. When tenant migrations are generated, they'll be in `priv/repo/tenant_migrations`

4. Run tenant migrations in addition to regular migrations:

```bash
# Run regular migrations
mix ash.migrate

# Run tenant migrations
mix ash_postgres.migrate --tenants
```

## Advanced Features

### Manual Relationships

For complex relationships that can't be expressed with standard relationship types:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Post.Relationships.HighlyRatedComments do
  use Ash.Resource.ManualRelationship
  use AshPostgres.ManualRelationship

  def load(posts, _opts, context) do
    post_ids = Enum.map(posts, & &1.id)

    {:ok,
     MyApp.Comment
     |> Ash.Query.filter(post_id in ^post_ids)
     |> Ash.Query.filter(rating > 4)
     |> MyApp.read!()
     |> Enum.group_by(& &1.post_id)}
  end

  def ash_postgres_join(query, _opts, current_binding, as_binding, :inner, destination_query) do
    {:ok,
     Ecto.Query.from(_ in query,
       join: dest in ^destination_query,
       as: ^as_binding,
       on: dest.post_id == as(^current_binding).id,
       on: dest.rating > 4
     )}
  end

  # Other required callbacks...
end

# In your resource:
relationships do
  has_many :highly_rated_comments, MyApp.Comment do
    manual MyApp.Post.Relationships.HighlyRatedComments
  end
end
```

### Using Multiple Repos (Read Replicas)

Configure different repos for reads vs mutations:

```elixir
postgres do
  repo fn resource, type ->
    case type do
      :read -> MyApp.ReadReplicaRepo
      :mutate -> MyApp.WriteRepo
    end
  end
end
```

## Best Practices

1. **Organize migrations**: Run `mix ash.codegen` after each meaningful set of resource changes with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   mix ash.codegen --name add_user_roles
   mix ash.codegen --name implement_post_tagging
   ```

2. **Use check constraints for domain invariants**: Enforce data integrity at the database level:
   ```elixir
   check_constraints do
     check_constraint :valid_status, check: "status IN ('pending', 'active', 'completed')"
     check_constraint :positive_balance, check: "balance >= 0"
   end
   ```

3. **Use custom statements for schema-only changes**: If you need to add database objects not directly tied to resources:
   ```elixir
   custom_statements do
     statement "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"pgcrypto\""
     statement "CREATE INDEX users_search_idx ON users USING gin(search_vector)"
   end
   ```

Remember that using AshPostgres provides a full-featured PostgreSQL data layer for your Ash application, giving you both the structure and declarative approach of Ash along with the power and flexibility of PostgreSQL.
